## Description
---
This app uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to retrieve data from a third-party API in order to look up the weather in a specific area by a user. The user is presented with a search box in which they enter a city name of their choice. After clicking search, the user is then able to see the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and a five day forecast of their selected city. The deployed application can be accessed here: , or in the about section of this repository.
